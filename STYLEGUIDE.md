# Biqmind CAPE style guide

The Biqmind CAPE style guide generally follows [the Microsoft style guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), with a handful of amendments and additions.

## Key aspects to remember

### Use active voice

Active voice helps clarify who the subject and the actor are in a sentence, and makes writing sound more confident.

There are times when passive voice makes more sense, but generally try to avoid it.

#### Example

> "You can find the setting by clicking on _Settings > Setting_"

_Instead of_

> "The setting can be found by clicking on _Settings > Setting_"

### Use second person

If you use second person (you) when addressing the user, it’s less confusing than first-person plural (we), as the user isn’t sure if you mean "we the readers", or "we the company".

Reserve "we" for when you need to refer to Biqmind CAPE the company, or an explicit collection of individuals in the community.

#### Example

> "You can follow this guide to learn the following"

_Instead of_

> "We can follow this guide to learn the following"

#### Example

> "The setting is the recommended way to configure the feature"

_Instead of_

> "We recommend the setting to configure the feature"

### US English

Use US English unless there is a specific brand or other reason to use British or International English. Some of (there are many more!) the easy to miss or forget differences between these flavors of English are:

- US English places punctuation inside any quotation marks, British English puts it outside.
- In certain word forms, US English uses one ‘l’, and British English uses two. For example:
  - Marvelled (British) vs Marveled (US)
  - Travelling (British) vs Traveling (US)

### Use present tense

Actions and interactions happen as the reader is reading the text, not in the future, unless it is something that is going to happen in the future, like a product announcement, new feature, or a long running process that returns results at an indefinite time.

#### Example

> "Clicking the button starts the process"

_Instead of_

> "Clicking the button will start the process"

### Capitalization and casing

All headings and subheadings should be in sentence case, which means you capitalize the first word of a title, and every other word should be lower case unless it’s a brand, name, place, or custom terminology. If you need help, try [titlecase.com](https://titlecase.com), or there are converters available for various text editors.

In all other text, use normal rules for capitalization, unless it is a specific brand name, technical term, branding, or style requirement.

### Formatting

#### Code

If something is code or configuration, use code formatting, whether it be one line embedded in text, or a code block. When using a code block, set the language in the opening triple backticks.

#### Instructions and paths

For paths, use italics, a file or directory path is not code.

The same applies for directing people to a certain menu item, use italics formatting with a single caret character (">") as a separator.

##### For example

> "Click _Menu > sub menu > item_ to enable feature
