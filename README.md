# Cape Documentation

Welcome to Cape documentation

# Getting Started

Cape documentation uses [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) from [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) (a static site generator geared towards technical documentation)

Install the Material package using the following pip command:

```
pip install mkdocs-material

```

Install the git revision date plugin using the following pip command:

```
pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin

```

For other types of installation, refer to Material [Getting Started](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#installation) guide

After installing the package, you need to download the cape doc repo, and then open with your fav code editor.

After editing the files, you need to build the docs by running the following command:

```
mkdocs build

```

To preview the local site hosted in your device, run the following command:

```
mkdocs serve

```
