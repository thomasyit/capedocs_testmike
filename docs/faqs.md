## Product

### What do you mean by last mile delivery?

### Does your tool handle DevSecOps?

### What would be the management console for the functionality for Smoke Tests?

CAPE has its own console for setup and configuration. CAPE is driven by an API-first approach - it can feed into other central consoles. Also as part of the whole toolchain, we will allow the connection into CI/CD e.g. the runner.

## Pricing

### My DevOps team is actually spinning up clusters all the time but mostly these are temporary. Will we be charged for these clusters? 
If your clusters are running for more than 24 hours, you will be charged for them. 

## Is your pricing model pro-rated?
Yes, we charge on a pro-rated basis based on active days.
