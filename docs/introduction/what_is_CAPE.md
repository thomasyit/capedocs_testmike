# What is CAPE

CAPE helps teams deliver Kubernetes applications consistently and confidently.

CAPE automates delivery of Kubernetes applications, sitting between continuous processes and clusters to enable complex deployment strategies anywhere including airgapped scenarios with limited, intermittent, or no connectivity.

CAPE plugs into existing tool chains supporting both pull or push deployment approaches, reducing time and expertise spent on scripting and customizing tooling for Kubernetes application deployments.
